    <hr>
    <p><strong>Image Galleries</strong> are a great way to share your pictures with your friends, family, and your followers. An image gallery will display a set of small images attached to a particular post or page. Readers can click on any image to launch a full-size carousel that allows them to scroll through the entire gallery one image at a time. With the slideshow option, images will automatically move from one to the next after a few seconds.</p>
    
    <p>You have several choices for how a gallery will be displayed in your post or page: a thumbnail grid layout or in a slideshow. All sites default to the thumbnail grid style and you can also style each gallery individually.</p>
