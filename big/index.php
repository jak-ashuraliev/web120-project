            <ul>
                <li>This takes a couple of weeks to complete; developing skills and repeating some work you'll revisit for your final project. We'll begin with an overview of what you'll be doing for this big project:
                </li>
                <li>
                    Produce a responsive layout by repurposing our WEB120's index.php page and styles (yah!), new main navigation with sub nav using CSS MenuMaker (find .zip file you need to use below), another ReCaptcha Contact Form, a Google calendar, a YouTube video and a Google map and more.
                </li>
                <li>Research and write a 300 word report and submit via a Google doc on each of the following topics (see screenshot image to the right below):</li>
                <il>Create a Lightbox II image gallery</il>
                <li>Submit the URL to your BIG website's main page</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>FTP and WRAP UP</h3>
            <p>Before the end of class be sure you've FTP'd your WEB120 work for tonight to your server space, maintained good notes on your weekly Google doc (you should have submitted its link by now) and allocated some study time to your Lynda library homework and this new research work assigned tonight over the weekend.</p>
