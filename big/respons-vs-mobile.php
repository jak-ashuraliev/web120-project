    <h2>RESPONSIVE vs MOBILE</h2>
    <h6>Budiu, Raluca. “Mobile-First Web Design vs. Responsive Web Design”, 28. Mar. 2018. <em>Darwin Digital</em></h6>
    <h3>What is Mobile First?</h3>
    <p>Before the days of smartphones websites were simple affair as we catered for desk-bound users. Mobility meant laptops which could easily use websites designed for desktops. Today life has moved on and we are now having to cater for myriads of devices and screen sizes. We are often asked to develop a <strong>Mobile App or a Responsive Design Website</strong> that adapts to users screen. <em>For the year 2017, the number of mobile users is expected to reach 4.7 billion and <strong>58.9%</strong> of those users will be using their mobile to access the internet. That’s nearly 2.7 billion people that will be using the internet on their phones. That number alone proves the importance of designing web pages that function optimally on mobile devices.</em></P>
    <p>Mobile-dedicated sites are sites designed specifically for mobile phones. They often live under a separate URL (e.g., m.site.com) and are completely distinct from the full site. They contain features or content that have been deemed appropriate for mobile; frequently, these are just a subset of what is available on the desktop. They are often contrasted with responsive sites, which typically contain the same content and functionality for mobile and desktop, but rearrange these features on mobile.</p>

    <p>Currently,<strong> 52.64% </strong>of the total traffic on the Internet is done via mobile phones, and by the end of the year experts from <strong>Zenith Media</strong> predict an increase of up to <strong>75%.</strong> With this information in mind, it is essential to understand what mobile-first design is and what its benefits are. Unlike responsive design, mobile-first is about a complete mobile user-experience: adapted app-like user-interface, less text, larger fonts, fast download speed, video and audio, one call-to-action per page, short forms, etcetera. Additionally, mobile browsers shortly will have access to more of the smartphone features like camera, haptic feedback, voice detection, so that a mobile-first design will be able to provide a unique experience to put your site ahead of the competition and drive traffic.</p>
    <p><strong>When developing with mobile first approach, It’s important to keep in mind the following:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make a Content Inventory</li>
        <li>Make a Visual Hierarchy</li>
        <li>Wireframe with the Smallest Breakpoints First</li>
        <li>Enlarge Touch Point</li>
        <li>Avoid Hover at All Costs</li>
        <li>Think Beyond Webpage</li>
        <li>Test It</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>What is Responsive Website Design?</h3>
    <p>Responsive Website Design is the formatting of a website that it can be optimally viewed from any type device: PC, tablet and smartphones. This might sound very familiar to the mobile first approach introduced above and this is because responsive web design is a feature of mobile first design. However, responsive is different in that it starts with designing for desktop and working down in formatting for tablet and mobile.</P>
    <p>The responsive website code recognises the size of screen in use and changes the presentation, order, and size of the content to fit the screen size whilst selecting the best font size and image size. Navigation keys are pushed under “Burger” button so you can open the navigation by clicking on the “Burger” button. This expands the navigation keys to a full list (and easy to read) of content of the website and the navigation keys including any drop-down menus. The skill in designing a Responsive Website is controlling the order that the content is displayed so that the content, marketing message, and logic still makes sense to the visitors not matter what device they use.</p>

    <p>From a design standpoint, responsive web design is a combination of moveable grids, layouts and images that function from CSS media queries. So when the user is looking at a website on their phone and then moves to a desktop, they have a similar experience due to the flexibility of the layout. Pictures and content may be arranged, but the user can do and see everything on mobile and desktop.</p>
    <p>Responsive came onto the scene before mobile first, that is sometimes why there is confusion between the two approaches. Another example of responsive website would be if you were to grab the corner of your browser and re-adjust the size. Make it smaller and you will see the content rearrange itself so that it is not cut off. Believe it or not, it was once common for web pages to just end where the browser did so that user had to scroll around to find content.</p>
    <p><strong>If you are interested in using a responsive design approach first, here are basic components to consider integrating:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <h4>Meta Tag</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Use a meta tag in the head of your code to reset your viewpoint. Most mobile browsers scale to wide viewpoints to fit the screen. The viewpoint meta tag will reset this so that the viewpoint width fits the device, rather than initial scale.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <h4>CSS Media Queries</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>UMedia Queries are the essential piece to creating a responsive design. It engineers the conditions that tell the browser how to render a page for a specified viewpoint width. Basically, you are writing the code that tells the webpage that if a screen is 700 pixel, make the content 50% of the screen. That can be written for all of screen sizes needed.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <p>In conclusion, this is a relatively easy decision to make: use the 80-20 rule. <strong>If 80% of your target audience is on desktop use, responsive design; if 80% are on mobile phone use mobile-first.</strong> You need to see where the usage trends are going, what your budget is and where your business will be in 3 years. If your business is entirely digital and providing an excellent user-experience cannot be ignored, maybe you should create two distinct sites adapted specially for both desktop and mobile users.</p>
